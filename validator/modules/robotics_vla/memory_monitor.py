# Runtime memory enforcement for the policy sandbox.
#
# The policy runs untrusted miner code, so the parameter cap cannot be enforced
# by statically auditing the loaded object graph: weights can be reconstructed at
# inference time (from a ``bytes`` blob, a file, a foreign module, a dynamic
# lookup) in ways a static walk cannot see. A hard ceiling on the worker's actual
# memory footprint is the representation-agnostic bound — however the weights are
# encoded, they still occupy memory. This module measures the worker's resident
# memory without third-party dependencies and kills it if it stays over budget.
